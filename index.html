      This is a simple web-based Italian Phrasebook that I'm making for my 10th
      grade 20 Time Project. The goal of this project is to teach basic but
      useful phrases and words that you can use to your travels to Italian
      speaking countries, with a focus on Italy and italian culture. This is
      mainly targeted towards beginners, and I myself am a beginner so don't be
      too surprised if you find any mistakes or errors throughout the project.
      This was sort of a dual project, as I wanted to mainly learn how to make a
      website, but I needed a topic for said website. I thought it would be good
      to learn a language at the same time, and thus this
